    "text": "Cisco Inc.\nIn my role, I was responsible for producing comprehensive documentation on Cisco’s Security Products, where I utilized my expertise in R and Python to develop data-driven dashboards that offer insightful analytics. My collaboration with the Buying Programs and Security Product Teams was instrumental in identifying a significant revenue gap of $15 million, which was attributed to overconsumption. To address this challenge and enhance data accessibility and accuracy, I spearheaded the creation of a central data warehouse. This initiative streamlined the collection and analysis of consumption data across Cisco’s buying programs and security products, facilitating more informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n\n\nPanorama Education\nIn my role, I was deeply involved in managing large-client data and ensuring quality assurance for the Customer Experience (CX) team, while concurrently crafting User Stories for the product team to enhance our software development efforts. My responsibilities also extended to the Survey Operations team, where I conducted user research and testing to establish success metrics for the Panorama product, providing valuable insights that shaped our strategic direction. Additionally, I utilized internal systems such as Salesforce, Asana, and Jira to streamline project workflows, which significantly improved our efficiency, evidenced by a reduction of 2.5 days in our average Service Level Agreement (SLA) time. This multi-faceted approach not only optimized our internal processes but also contributed to a more robust and user-centric product development cycle.\n\n\nRippleMatch\nIn my position, I had the opportunity to work closely with the leaders of RippleMatch’s Leadership Team, employing Agile frameworks and Scrum methodologies to drive our projects forward effectively. My role involved leveraging growth strategies that successfully increased customer retention by a factor of 1.4 and expanded our user base by 127 users, demonstrating a significant impact on our market presence. Additionally, I took on the responsibility of assessing various growth and performance metrics, which was pivotal in creating detailed progress reports. These reports were not just reflections of our current state but also instrumental in designing new growth strategies. This analytical approach allowed us to continuously refine our tactics and contribute to the company’s evolving success story."

    "text": "SAM\nAt UCLA, I developed SAM, a Smart Attendance Monitor, designed to innovate the way attendance is tracked and managed. I introduced this product idea to UCLA DevX, a club I was actively involved in, which led to my role as the product manager for SAM. I guided the project through its entire lifecycle, from establishing engineering and UI/UX teams to creating the initial prototypes, conducting usability testing, and gathering user feedback.\nSAM utilizes Estimote beacons, leveraging Bluetooth technology to automatically detect devices in proximity, thereby streamlining the attendance process. The system is designed not only to simplify attendance tracking for faculty by uploading data to a dedicated platform but also to provide students with a log of their attendance. This project was a significant step towards modernizing attendance monitoring at educational institutions, showcasing a blend of innovative technology and practical application.\n\n\nTerra\nI was involved in a Clean-Tech project aimed at fostering sustainable waste management practices by connecting users with local composting opportunities and offering comprehensive information on composting techniques. The project featured an online forum and chat functionality, enabling users to engage with experts and fellow platform users, fostering a community of environmentally conscious individuals.\nMy role in this project allowed me to hone a diverse set of skills. On the digital front, I worked with UI/UX design, cloud technologies, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and blockchain, gaining hands-on experience in these cutting-edge areas. From a business perspective, I applied project and product management principles, utilized agile frameworks, and developed my ability to pitch ideas effectively. My human skills were equally challenged and developed, as I navigated problem-solving, contributed to social impact, and leveraged emotional intelligence to drive the project forward.\nA notable innovation I introduced to the project was the incorporation of gamification elements, which transformed waste management into a social, engaging, and competitive activity. This approach not only made the process more enjoyable for users but also significantly amplified the project’s impact on promoting sustainable practices in waste management.\n\n\nPaper: The Synergetic Disadvantage of Historical Institutionalized Racism in Chicago and COVID-19 on Nutritional Quality and Access for Minority Populations\nIn my capacity as a statistician, I contributed to a critical paper analyzing the intersection of historical institutionalized racism in Chicago and the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on its impact on nutritional quality and access for minority populations. The paper aimed to uncover the nuanced ways in which long-standing racial disparities, exacerbated by the pandemic, affect food accessibility within different community segments.\nOur study leveraged HOLC mapping data to identify redlined areas in Chicago, correlating these regions with food accessibility and SNAP usage. By analyzing data before and after the implementation of federal COVID SNAP boost policies, we aimed to discern the policy’s effectiveness in mitigating food insecurity among minority communities historically subjected to redlining.\nOur findings were telling. We observed a marked disparity in food access and SNAP usage, with significantly lower accessibility in lower-graded, predominantly minority neighborhoods. Despite the SNAP boost during COVID, our analysis revealed that the policy did not fully bridge the gap in food insecurity among the graded regions, pointing to a need for more comprehensive strategies to address these systemic issues.\nThe research underscored the persistent influence of historical racism on current social and health outcomes, advocating for more robust policy interventions to tackle food insecurity in marginalized communities effectively. This paper not only contributed to the academic discourse but also aimed to inform policy-making, highlighting the importance of integrating historical context and social equity into public health strategies.\n\nYou can access an overview of the paper here."
