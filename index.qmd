# About Me

I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in Statistics and Data Science. I have a passion for Product Management and have work experience at Cisco, Panorama Education, and RippleMatch. I enjoy using data to break down complex problems and visualizing my findings through wireframes. My relevant coursework at UCLA includes: Program in Computing (C++), Linear Algebra and Applications, Statistics, Programming with R, Data-Driven Mathematical Modeling, Python and Other Technologies for Data Science. \
\
Outside of school, I am interested in basketball, football, and hip-hop music. I also enjoy art museums and late night walks along the ocean side! \
